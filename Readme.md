1. Module Import: 

<!-- const express = require("express"); -->

This line imports the express module, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. To use this, you would have had to install the Express library using npm (Node.js Package Manager) with the command npm install express.

2. Create an Express Application:

<!-- const app = express(); -->

Here, the express() function is invoked, which creates an instance of an Express application. This instance (app) is what you'll use to set up routes, middleware, and listen for incoming requests.

3. Start the Server:

<!-- app.listen(5000, () =>{
  console.log("Server run well");
}); -->

The listen method starts the server on the specified port, which in this case is 5000. When the server starts successfully, the callback function gets executed, and it logs "Server run well" to the console.

When you run this code (e.g., with node yourFileName.js), you're starting an Express.js server that listens for requests on port 5000. However, as written, this server doesn't do much yet since no routes or endpoints have been defined. Typically, you'd see further app.get(), app.post(), etc., methods defined to handle specific types of requests and respond accordingly.

If you were to run the script and then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser, you would get a "Cannot GET /" message because you haven't defined any behavior for the root URL ("/").

4. Route Definition:

<!-- app.get("/", ...); -->

This line defines a new route for the server. The app.get method is used to handle GET requests to a specific path, which in this case is the root ("/") of the server. This means that when someone accesses the root of your server (like visiting http://localhost:5000 in the browser), this route will be triggered.

5. Request and Response:

<!-- (req, res) =>{
   res.send("Mpesa Programmimg in progress");
} -->

This part is a callback function that gets executed when the route is hit. The function takes two parameters:

req (request): Contains various information about the incoming request, like headers, query parameters, and the body.
res (response): This object is used to send data back to the client. In this case, the server responds with the string "Mpesa Programmimg in progress".
The res.send() method sends a response back to the client. The string passed into this method ("Mpesa Programmimg in progress") will be displayed in the browser or received by the client making the request.

To sum up, with this added code, when you access the root path of the server (i.e., http://localhost:5000), you will no longer see the "Cannot GET /" message. Instead, you'll see "Mpesa Programmimg in progress". This indicates that you've successfully defined behavior for that endpoint.


6. Import Axios:

<!-- const axios = require("axios"); -->

This line imports the axios module. Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests. It's often favored because it provides a clean API for making requests and handling responses, and it returns promises which make it easy to work with asynchronous operations. To use axios, you would need to have installed it using npm (Node.js Package Manager) with the command npm install axios.

7. Define createToken Function:

<!-- const createToken = async(req, res, next) => {
} -->

Here, an asynchronous function createToken is defined, but its body is empty. The function accepts three parameters:

req: Represents the request object.
res: Represents the response object.
next: A middleware function which can be invoked to pass control to the next middleware function in line.
The async keyword indicates that this function may make use of the await keyword inside its body to handle asynchronous operations more comfortably, likely making HTTP requests using axios.

As it stands, this function doesn't do anything. The logic inside this function would likely be related to creating some form of token, perhaps for authentication or API access.

8. Export the Function:

<!-- module.exports = { createToken }; -->

This line exports the createToken function, which means it can be required and used in other parts of your Node.js application. By exporting it, you're allowing other modules or files in your project to import and use the createToken function.

To recap, this section of code sets up the foundation for making HTTP requests using Axios, provides a placeholder for a function that might be related to token creation, and then exports this function for use elsewhere in the application.

9. Initialize Express Router:

<!-- const router = express.Router(); -->

Here, the Router method from the Express module is invoked to create a new router object. This router object will be used to define routes specific to this module, keeping the code modular and organized.

10. Import the createToken Function:

<!-- const {createToken} = require("../controller/token"); -->

This line imports the createToken function from a file located at "../controller/token". The .. means it's looking one directory up from the current file, and then inside a controller directory for a file named token.js. The curly braces around createToken indicate destructuring, which means we're extracting the createToken property (or function, in this case) from the exports of the token.js file.

11. Define a Route with the Router:

<!-- router.get("/", createToken); -->

Using the router object, a GET route for the root path ("/") is defined. When a GET request is made to this path, the createToken function will be executed. Remember, createToken was just a stub in the previous code, so in practice, it would contain logic to handle the request and send a response.
